1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, in this lecture I'm going to show you how to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
set up your development environment and create your first Angular

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
project. So the first thing we need to install is the latest version

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of Node. In case you have never worked with Node before,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
it's basically a run time environment for executing JavaScript code

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
outside the browser. In this course we're not going to work with Node,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but Node provides some tools that we need to

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
build Angular projects. So if you haven't installed Node, head over to node.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
js.org, on this page you can see the latest version of Node

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
for your operating system, so here is the latest stable version

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
is 6.11, and the latest version is version

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
8. Now this latest version has more features, but is not

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
quite stable yet. So go ahead and install the latest

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
stable version. When you do that, open up the terminal

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
on Mac, or command prompt on Windows, and type node,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
--version. So you can see on my machine,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm running Node version 6.10. The minimum

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
required for building applications is version 6.9.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Once you have Node, then we're going to use a tool called

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Node Package Manager, or NPM, to install

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
third party libraries. One of the libraries we're going to install in this lecture

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
is Angular CLI, which stands for Command-line

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Interface. So it's a Command-line tool, that we use to

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
create a new Angular project, or generate some boiler plate code

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
as well as create deployable packages. So once again in

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the terminal, you run NMP, install,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
-g, which stands for global, and finally the name

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
of the package, which is @Angular/

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
cli. If you don't put -g here, Angular

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
CLI will be installed only in the current folder, and it's not going to be

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
accessible anywhere else. Now if you're on Mac, you need to put

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
sudo at the beginning of this command to execute it as an

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
administrator. Alright next, we need to enter our password,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and now this process is going to take a little while.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Alright, beautiful, we installed Angular CLI.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now to ensure that the installation was successful,

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we can type ng--version.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So again you can see I'm running Angular CLI version 1

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
.1.0, and below that you can see the version of Node

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
on my machine. Once again, it's 6.10
