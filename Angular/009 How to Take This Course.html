            <p>Congratulations!You've reached the end of the first section! Before moving forward, let me quickly clarify something:</p><p><br></p><p>I created the first edition of this course with Angular 2 beta in early 2016. There have been a few breaking changes since then. So, <strong>Ire-created the entire course with Angular 4</strong>. <strong>The first 10 sections of the course include the second edition of this course recorded with Angular 4.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Since Udemy provides a "life-time access"to students, I am not allowed to delete the older outdated content. So, <strong>all the older Angular 2 videos are still available from section 11 onwards.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As a new student,you don't really need to watch these videos.</strong> These videos are merely there for existing students that may still be taking the course.</p><p><br></p><p>All the best and continue watching!</p><p>Mosh</p>
