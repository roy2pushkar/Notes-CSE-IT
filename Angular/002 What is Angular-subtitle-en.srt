1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,710
So in case you're an absolute beginner with angular.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,500
Let me quickly explain in two minutes what Engler is and why you should learn it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,840
And Geller is a framework for building client applications in HD.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:22,060
Mel CSSA and either java script or a language like typescript that compiles to javascript a typescript

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:28,120
is more common in the end user community because Angleterre itself has been written with typescript.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,950
If you have never worked with Tasca before don't worry at all it's very easy to get familiar with it.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,010
In this course now one question that a lot of beginners have is why do we need angular.

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,320
Can we not use plain old javascript or Jey query.

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,040
We certainly can and that's how a lot of web applications out there are built.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,160
But as our applications get more complex vanilla javascript or J.A.G. code becomes hard to maintain.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,170
We need a way to properly structure our application.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,650
Sure there are javascript patterns out there that help us with destructuring But these patterns are

13
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,550
hard to understand for a lot of beginners to javascript.

14
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:13,390
Plus a lot of applications built with vanilla javascript or Jay Cuore are hard to test and that's why

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,900
over the past few years various frameworks have been built and evolved to make web application development

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,700
easier and gular is an example of such frameworks.

17
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,560
It gives our applications a clean and loosely couple's structure that is easy to understand and easy

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,760
to maintain.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,820
It also brings in a lot of utility code that we can reuse in various applications especially when dealing

20
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:43,460
with the user's navigation and the browser history plus applications built with angular or more testable

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,200
so we can easily write automated tests to test various parts of our application.

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,970
As I will show you later in the course.

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,560
So to answer this question no you don't need a framework like angular to build client applications but

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,140
using Engler makes your life a lot easier.
