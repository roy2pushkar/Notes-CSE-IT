1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So with Angular CLI

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
in place, now we can create a new Angular project. So

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we type ng new, and let's call this project

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
hello-world.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So this generates a bunch of files and folders, and then

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it's going to use NPM to download the third party libraries.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Alright, our project is successfully created.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, to start coding we need a code editor.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The editor I'm going to use in this course is Visual Studio Code, or

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
vs code. It's a beautiful, cross platform

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
light weight editor, you can download at code.visutalstudio.com.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you don't like this editor, feel free to use any editors that

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you prefer, you can use Sublime, you can use Atom, or any editors.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now if you're going to use vs code, I want you to add it to

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the path, so you can easily open it from the terminal. So here,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
if you're using Mac, press Shift, Command, and

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
P, or if you're using Windows, press Shift, Control,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and P. This opens up the command palette.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, here type, code, look at this command here.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Install, code command, in path.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
With this we can go to the terminal,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
in the folder where we created a new project hello-world, simply type

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
code, period. So, this opens

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
vs code, pointing to the current folder. Now in the next lecture, we're going to look at

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the structure, you're going to learn what files and folders we have here, but before

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we get there, let's make sure that this application works.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, back in the terminal, once again we use Angular CLI to load

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
our application in the web server. So we type ng,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
space, serve.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So now we have a light development server listening

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
on local host port 4200, and Angular

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
CLI also compiled our application, it generated bundles,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
for JavaScript and CSS files, so we can open up

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Chrome, and head over to localhost, port 4200.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Beautiful! This is our first Angular app.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Next, we're going to look at the structure of our new Angular project.
