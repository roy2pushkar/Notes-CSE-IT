1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:09,870
So earlier I told you that a component encapsulates the data the logic and the HMO markup for a view.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:17,810
So in this example in our courses component we have HMO markup but we don't have any data or any logic.

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,770
So let's extend this example and take it to the next level.

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:29,090
I want to define a field in this class to hold the title of this page so title I'm going to set this

5
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,430
to List Of course this.

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:40,380
Now I want to display this title in our template dynamically so I'm going to remove this hardcoded label

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,120
here it angular.

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:49,350
We have this special syntax double curly braces and we use this to render something in our template

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,000
dynamically.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,410
So here I can put this title field.

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,580
This expression will be evaluated at runtime and the value of this title field will be placed in our

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,550
dorm.

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,150
Now if the value of the title field changes at some point in the future angular will automatically update

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,040
the DOM.

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,470
This is one of the beauties of Ingela framework.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,660
So here we have this concept of data binding.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,450
So we're binding our view to have filled in this component whenever the value of that field changes.

18
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,990
The view is automatically notified and updated right now let's save the changes back in the browser.

19
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,470
All right here's our new title.

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,390
Beautiful.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,260
Now back here we don't always have to put the name of Phil here.

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,510
We can write any simple javascript expressions.

23
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,440
For example I can put a string here.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,260
Title column and then concatenate this with our title field.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,380
Save like this is our new title.

26
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,380
Here we can also call a method in this class to get some value.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:06,430
For example I've modified a method get title and here I'm going to return this the title now here we

28
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:13,720
can simply call our new method get title like this and we'll get the exact same result.

29
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,620
There you go.

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,490
This of course is so this special syntax year we call it strange.

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,250
In the next lecture I'm going to show you how to render a list of courses here.
