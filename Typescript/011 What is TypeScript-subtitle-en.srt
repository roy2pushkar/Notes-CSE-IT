1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, what is TypeScript?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
TypeScript, is not an entirely new language, it's a super

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
set of JavaScript, so that means any valid JavaScript code is

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
also valid TypeScript code, but TypeScript has additional

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
features that do not exist in the current version of JavaScript

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
supported by most browsers out there. For example,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in TypeScript we have this concept of strong or static typing,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
if you have worked with languages like C# and Java, you will know that in these

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
languages, when we define the variable, we need to specify the type of

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that variable. Now, in TypeScript, typing is optional, so we don't have to use

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
this feature. But using this feature, makes our applications more

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
predictable, and it also makes it easier to debug them when something

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
goes wrong. TypeScript also brings quite a few object oriented

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
features that we have missed in JavaScript for a long time. We have

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the concept of Classes, Interfaces, Constructors,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Access Modifiers, like public and private, Fills, Properties,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Generics and so on. You're going to learn about this in this section.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now, another benefit of using TypeScript is that with TypeScript we

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
catch errors at Compile-time, instead of Run-time, but of course

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
not all kinds of errors, but a lot of errors. So there is a compilation

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
step involved, and when we compile our TypeScript code, we can catch these errors

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and fix them before deploying our application. And finally,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
another benefit of using TypeScript, is that we get access to

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
some great tools out there. One thing I personally love about TypeScript is

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the intelligence that we get in our code editors. Again,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you're going to see that in this section. So TypeScript is a beautiful language

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and it's basically a superset of JavaScript, so any valid JavaScript code

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
is also valid TypeScript code. Now, the browsers out there,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
they don't understand TypeScript, and it's very unlikely that they're going to support it

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
in the future, so we need to compile for more accurately,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
so we Transpile our TypeScript code, into JavaScript.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, this is part of building our application, whenever we build our application,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
TypeScript compiler kicks in, and it Transpiles

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
our TypeScript code into JavaScript code our browsers can understand.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now, that's enough introduction. Next I'm going to show you how to install

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
TypeScript, and write your first TypeScript program.
