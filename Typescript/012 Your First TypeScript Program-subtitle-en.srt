1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this lecture, I'm going to show you how to install

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
TypeScript, and write your first TypeScript program. So here,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in the terminal, we're not going to work with Angular in this section, we're going to purely

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
focus on TypeScript. So first we need to install TypeScript

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
globally on our machine. So, npm,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
install -g, which stands for global, typescript.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And of course, if you're on Mac, you need to put sudo at the

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
front. Alright,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
beautiful, so I've installed the latest version of TypeScript, which is currently

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
version 2.3.4. Now we can type

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
tsc, which stands for TypeScript Compiler, --,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
version. Again, you can see that I'm running TypeScript,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
2.3.4. Alright, now I'm going to create a new folder for

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
this section, so let's call ts-hello.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go to this folder, now here I'm going to create

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
a new file, and open it with vs code. So, code

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
main.ts. So,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
now I'm going to write some plain JavaScript code, and I want to show you that all this

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, so first

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to define a function, let's call this log,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that takes a message,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and here we simply log that message on the console,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
like this.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then I'm going to declare a global variable, let's call this

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
message, and set it to this string, Hello World.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And finally call our log function, message.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So this is just plain JavaScript code, right?

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Save, back in the terminal, we need to Transpile

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
this TypeScript file into JavaScript, so

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
tsc, or TypeScript Compiler, main.ts.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, if you look at the files in this folder, look what we have

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
main.js, and main.ts. Now this Transpilation,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
or compilation step, when you are building an Angular app, happens

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
under the hood, so you don't have to manually call the TypeScript,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
compiler. In fact when you run your application using

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
ng serve, Angular CLI, calls TypeScript compiler under the hood,

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
to transpile all of our TypeScript code. Alright, now let's

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
open our main.js file. So code.main.js.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So it's exactly the same code that we wrote

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but now it's in a JavaScript file. So all JavaScript code

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
is also valid TypeScript code. Now back in the terminal, I

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
can execute this code using node. So node, main.js

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And we got the Hello World message on the console.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So for the next lecture, we're going to look at specific features of

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
TypeScript that we don't currently have in JavaScript.
