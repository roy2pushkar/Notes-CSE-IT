00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,080
In order to build applications with angular you need to be comfortable with typescript.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,350
So in this section I'm going to introduce you to the fundamentals of typescript an object oriented programming

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,520
principles.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:21,300
So by the end of this section you will have a good understanding of type annotations Aro functions interfaces

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,210
classes instructors access modifiers properties and modules.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,700
If you're familiar with this concept and know how to implement them in typescript feel free to skip

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,950
this section and move on to Engler.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,090
Otherwise you really need to watch every lecture in the section.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,010
So now let's get started.
